Here's a step-by-step guide to complete the tasks you've outlined for the "BudgetPlanner" project:

### 1. Create a folder and initialize it as a Git repository:
```bash
mkdir BudgetPlanner
cd BudgetPlanner
git init
```

### 2. Add the required files to the folder:
```bash
touch index.html style.css script.js
```

### 3. Check the repository's status to confirm the files are untracked:
```bash
git status
```

### 4. Stage all files for the first commit:
```bash
git add index.html style.css script.js
```

### 5. Commit the staged files with the message:
```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: Added project base files"
```

### 6. Create a remote repository on GitHub and link it to your local repository:
- On GitHub, create a new repository named "BudgetPlanner".
- Copy the repository's URL (e.g., `https://github.com/yourusername/BudgetPlanner.git`).
- Link the local repository to the remote repository:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/BudgetPlanner.git
```

### 7. Push the local repository to the remote repository:
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

### 8. Clone the remote repository onto a teammate's machine:
- On the teammate's machine, run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BudgetPlanner.git
```

### 9. Pull updates from the remote repository after new changes:
- After a teammate adds files or makes changes and pushes them, pull the latest updates:
```bash
git pull origin main
```

### 10. Check the log to verify changes pushed by your teammate:
```bash
git log --name-only
```
