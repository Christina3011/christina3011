Here's a detailed walkthrough for collaborating on the "Report Generator" feature branch:

### 1. Create and switch to the branch `feature-report-generator`:
```bash
git checkout -b feature-report-generator
```

### 2. Modify `report.js` to add the report generator functionality:
- Edit the `report.js` file with the necessary updates using your code editor.

### 3. Stage the changes made to `report.js`:
```bash
git add report.js
```

### 4. Commit the staged changes with the specified message:
```bash
git commit -m "Added report generator functionality"
```

### 5. Push the `feature-report-generator` branch to the remote repository for review:
```bash
git push origin feature-report-generator
```

### 6. Invite a teammate to collaborate:
- Share the branch name (`feature-report-generator`) and repository link with your teammate.

### 7. Pull updates from the branch after your teammate commits changes:
```bash
git pull origin feature-report-generator
```

### 8. Resolve conflicts in `report.js` during the pull:
- Open the conflicting file (`report.js`) and manually resolve the conflicts.
- Stage the resolved file:
```bash
git add report.js
```
- Commit the resolution:
```bash
git commit -m "Resolved conflicts in report.js"
```

### 9. Merge `feature-report-generator` into the `main` branch after testing:
- Switch to the `main` branch:
```bash
git checkout main
```
- Merge the feature branch:
```bash
git merge feature-report-generator
```

### 10. Push the updated `main` branch to the remote repository:
```bash
git push origin main
```

### 11. Confirm changes by viewing the log:
```bash
git log --name-only
```

This process ensures smooth collaboration, conflict resolution, and merging while developing the "Report Generator" feature. Let me know if you need clarification on any step! ðŸ˜Š
